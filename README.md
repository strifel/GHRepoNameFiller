# Github Auto Filler
Ever seen these "confirm the repository name" fields on github.<br>
Sometimes they are really annoying, when you want to quickly archive a few of your repos.<br>
This is a simple Firefox Plugin which automatically fills these fields with the repo name.

## Supported Fields
- Make Public/Make private
- Archive/Unarchive
- Delete
